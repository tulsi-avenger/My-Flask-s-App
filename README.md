# My Flask's App

https://chocolateday.herokuapp.com

In devoloping phase :)

This is my first flask website created using flask(python framework) and jinja2(requires for extending html and css file) .
(deployed on the day of chocolate day :) )
It's deployed on heroku. 
Heroku manages app deployments using git, a famous version control system.
